		</li>

		Detect old versions of Jcrop that hides the image when going back
		</li>
	<li>1.3.3: Use the crossOrigin attribute only if present to avoid problems with some versions of Firefox
		</li>

	<li>1.3.4: 9-February-2015. German and French translations by Contens.de<br>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<h3>1. Copying the files</h3>
<p>Extract the contents of the zip in you plugins directory, so it ends up like
    this<br>
    <!--<img src="installation.png" alt="Screenshot of installation" width="311" height="346" longdesc="#install">-->
    </p>
<pre id="--install">
ckeditor\
	...
	images\
	lang\
	plugins\
		...
		imagecrop\
			plugin.js
			dialog\
			docs\
			lang\
		...
	skins\
	themes\
</pre>
<h3>2. Adding it to CKEditor</h3>
<p>Now add the plugin in your <em>config.js</em> or custom js configuration file like you did for the SimpleUploads, adding a comma:
<code>config.extraPlugins='simpleuploads,imagecrop'; </code>
</p>

<h3>3. Configuration</h3>
<p>The configuration is provided as a single "imagecrop" object in the configuration of each editor, example:</p>
<code>// Configuration for ImageCrop
config.imagecrop = {
	cropsizes : [
		{width:120, height:120, title:"120px square", name:"Thumbnail"},
		{width:400, height:300, title:"400 * 300", name:"Content picture"},
		{width:960, height:350, title:"960 * 350", name:"Big header"},
		{width:0, height:0, title:"No restrictions", name:"Free crop"}
		],

	formats : [
		{ title:"JPG - Low quality", value:"jpg60"},
		{ title:"JPG - Normal quality", value:"jpg80", attributes:"selected"},
		{ title:"JPG - High quality", value:"jpg90"},
		{ title:"PNG (for texts)", value:"png"}
		],

	maximumDimensions : {width:1024, height:1024}
};</code>


<p>The <b>cropsizes</b> property defines the cropping sizes that you want to allow, you must add an array of objects. Each object has four properties:<br>
"width": Final width of the resized area<br>
"height": Final height of the resized area<br>
"title": Tooltip that will be shown while hovering the button<br>
"name": Text of the button that the user will see</p>
<code>cropsizes : [
	{width:80, height:80, title:"small thumbail (80x80)", name:"Thumbnail"},
	{width:400, height:300, title:"400 * 300", name:"Content picture"},
	{width:0, height:0, title:"No restrictions", name:"Free crop"}
	]
</code>
<p>You can define as many options as you want, each one will be available as a button for the user to quickly select the final dimensions of the image.<br>
If width and height are zero the user will be able to crop the image at any size</p>

<p>After selecting the cropped area, the user has the option to select the quality that will be used to save the image, you can modify the available options with the <b>formats</b> property:</p>
<code>formats : [
	{ title:"JPG - Low quality", value:"jpg60"},
	{ title:"JPG - Normal quality", value:"jpg80", attributes:"selected"},
	{ title:"JPG - High quality", value:"jpg90"},
	{ title:"PNG (for texts)", value:"png"}
	],
</code>
<p>At the moment the maximum set of options is limited to the four ones provided above, you can remove any one that you don't like or change the default one</p>

<p>Finally, if the user presses OK on the dialog without cropping the image you can force it to be resized to a maximum width and height (preserving the ratio) with the <b>maximumDimensions</b> setting</p>
<code>maximumDimensions : {width:1024, height:1024}</code>

<p id="CORS">CORS: In order to edit images hosted in another domain you'll need to enable the remote server to send the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image">CORS headers</a> when requested. That just allows the usage of the images, but in order to avoid misleading the users into thinking that they might be allowed to edit any image, ImageCrop will try to check if the editing will work when showing the context menu. Unfortunately to fully check if it works it might require a new request of the image, and at that time we can't change the context menu.<br>
So if you know that you'll be working with a CORS enabled server, set the <b>skipCORScheck</b> property in the config.imagecrop object to true, that way the check won't be performed upon showing  the context menu and only when the user launches the editing dialog.</p>

<h3>4. Use it</h3>
<p>Clear your cache and reload your editor. <br>
Now add an image (drag&amp;drop, take a screenshot and paste it, use the Upload button, ...), and the cropping dialog will popup:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you just press OK then it will be uploaded without changes</li>
	<li>If you select a size, then the cropping rectangle will appear that allows to select the area of interest in the picture<br>
	By pressing Crop you can finally select the quality according to the options that you have allowed</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Translations</h3>
<p>To add a new translation open plugin.js and search for "translations", it's at line 6 and add your language (the example is based on adding Polish ('pl')
  <code>    // translations
    lang : 'en,es',</code>
to<code>    // translations
    lang : 'en,es,pl',</code></p>
<p>
Then in the lang folder copy the en.js to pl.js, edit that file and in the first line set your language:
<code>CKEDITOR.addPluginLang( "imagecrop", "pl",</code>
and finally, translate all the text between quotes :-)</p>
<p>If you send it back to us, we will include it in the next versions.</p>
